# TPP-EDA
Exploratory data analysis of survey results on tokenizing product passports; includes a bit of NLP on open responses

## Explanation
This was the R code I've been using for a conference paper submitted to EC3 (paper and data publication pending acceptance). A survey was issued consisting of 30 questions that were Liekert-based, multiple choice, and open text. Thus, different analyses were used.

For the open text responses I used LDA topic modeling (an NLP technique) for extracting themes from each "document".

## Implementation
I used R Studio, should be relatively easy to adapt
